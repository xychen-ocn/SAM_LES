# SAM_LES
This repository stores python scripts (jupyter notebook) or matlab scripts to analysis SAM LES 
output.


To-DO:
 - test resolution using the RICO setup
   - started with the smallest domain: 12.8km x 12.8km x 4km which is the standard test case in SAM
 - figure out how to put in inhomogeneous surface temperature
 - how to set up non periodic boundary condition (Fringe technique as in Sullivan et al. 2020) 
 - dry spin-up and then add tracer or moisture in ?
