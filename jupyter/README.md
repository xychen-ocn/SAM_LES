### Progress Log

- added block averaging and sorted the blocks by TWP into 4 quartiles as in BB2017;
- obtained the quartile-averaged variables in the 2Dcom SAM output;


### saved dataset for testing:
- saved the quartile-averaged variables into a netCDF data for testing purpose.


### Errors and To-Dos:
- [] need to propagate data attributes in xarray datasets to enable labeling the x, y axis in my DataVisualize class;

- [x] the quartile_evolution methods in the DataVisualize class is not working somehow, need to be tested with another script. (tested and it is working now)
